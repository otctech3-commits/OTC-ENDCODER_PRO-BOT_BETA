Telegram Video Encoding BotThis is a powerful Telegram bot capable of video encoding, compression, watermarking, and manipulation using the python-telegram-bot library and the FFmpeg tool.FeaturesThe bot supports an extensive list of user and admin commands, including:Quality Control: /144p up to /2160p conversion.Manipulation: /compress, /cut, /crop, /merge.Assets: /setthumb, /setwatermark, /extract_audio, /extract_thumb.Security: /spoiler to send media with spoiler tags.Admin Tools: /crf, /preset, user management, and queue control.(Note: In the provided code, the actual FFmpeg execution for these commands is simulated using print statements. You would need to replace the mock logic with real Python subprocess calls to the FFmpeg binary.)Deployment on Render (or similar services)This project is set up to be deployed easily using a Docker container, which allows us to ensure the critical video processing tool, FFmpeg, is installed.PrerequisitesA Telegram Bot Token (from BotFather).Your personal Telegram User ID (used for the /admin commands).A Render account (or another service like Heroku or any VM).Setup StepsClone the Repository:git clone [your-github-repo-link]
Configure Environment Variables:You must set the following environment variables in your Render service dashboard:VariableDescriptionExample ValueTELEGRAM_BOT_TOKENYour token obtained from BotFather.123456:ABC-DEF123456ADMIN_IDYour Telegram User ID (must be an integer).123456789Deployment (Using Docker):This repository includes a Dockerfile which is the recommended way to deploy, as it guarantees FFmpeg is installed alongside Python.Render Web Service:Create a new Web Service.Connect it to your GitHub repository.Choose the Docker environment runtime.Set the Build Command to: (leave empty, Docker handles the build).Set the Start Command to: (leave empty, Procfile handles the command).Render Background Worker (Recommended for Polling):If you plan to run the bot using long-polling (as configured in the Python file), a Background Worker is more appropriate than a Web Service. The setup is similar, but you select "Background Worker" instead of "Web Service."FFmpeg IntegrationThe Dockerfile handles the installation of FFmpeg, which is the engine for all video processing. The core bot logic in telegram_encoding_bot.py uses the generate_ffmpeg_command function to simulate how the commands would be executed.For a fully functional bot, you would replace the simulation:In the command handlers (convert_720p, extract_audio_command, etc.), you must download the user's video file first (context.bot.get_file).Use Python's subprocess module to execute the FFmpeg command string generated by generate_ffmpeg_command.Upload the resulting output file (e.g., output_720p.mp4) back to Telegram.Delete the local files to save disk space.
